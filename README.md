# L3_V3_tech_interview_prep

The aim of this class is NOT to grind leetcode. That is a recipe for disaster. We want to make sure that you are truly learning data structures and algorithms. While it may seem tedious, it will help you out in the long run in your career. What I want you to take away from this is how to approach problem solving and unit testing with a foundation in data structures and algorithms. Make sure you are in the right mindset. You will not come up with solutions to some of these problems, it took mathmaticians years in some cases AND THATS OK. Remember that leetcode is a playground for us to practice our understanding of the data structure, without a solid understanding of what we are doing, we will always be lost. Take your time and give yourself grace. 

## Each Weekâ€™s Folder Should Contain:
* README.md
   -  Intro to the topic, key concepts, example walkthroughs, links to additional reading.

* problems.js / problems.py
   - The file where students write their solutions.

* problems.test.js / test_problems.py
   - Starter test suite using Jest for the first week and PyTest then on.
   
For the first few problems the testing will be provided for you but it is important that you begin to familiarize yourself with creating your own unit test, specifically we will focus on doing this with python. 

It may seem like there is not a lot of content here, but remember that this is supplemental and used to get you started for the week. We will have a lesson covering the topic for that week, a folder for that week and finally some HW. The HW has two parts, we will be following along with Harvards CS50 data structures course to get an understanding of DS&A as well as using the provided textbook pdf. The reading and the video are super important as they are what we are using to build our foundation.
